# Intelligent-Animal-Repulsion-System-for-Crop-Protection
My capstone project that uses machine learning techniques for recognition of object

This work provides a thorough description of the design, development, and evaluation of 
an intelligent animal repulsion system that allows to detect and recognize the birds as well 
as generate ultrasonic signals tailored to each species of the birds. The suggested solution 
is built on IoT platforms that offer a reasonable trade-off between performance, cost, and 
energy consumption. These platforms take into account the limits arising from the rural 
setting in terms of energy supply and network connectivity. In order to determine the best 
animal recognition HW/SW platform to be integrated with the sound generator, we 
deployed and tested by running real-time object detector (YOLO and Tiny-YOLO) with 
custom-trained models. Finally, this project addresses how the combined technology 
employed can assist farmers and agronomists in their decision-making and management 
processes.
**Specific Contribution:**
• Labelling images in the dataset using LabelImg software.
• Training different versions of YOLOv8 for the selection of best.
**Specific Learning**
• Understanding the working of MQTT for communication establishment.
• Understanding the working of YOLO for object recognition.
• Leant how to extract results from running model.
**Technical Limitations & Ethical Challenges Faced**
• Difficulty in training the model and selection of number of iterations for best fit.
• Difficulty in porting the model over to IoT edge node.
